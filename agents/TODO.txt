Rewrite this in C++ and test for speed (it's too slow in Python)

Maybe start by putting output in a file, but what we really want is to wrap the
code in Python. Have a C++ routine run the simulation with the objects, then
get all positions at the end of the simulation. Output to Python via ctypes
and extern "C". Python then plots the result.

Eventually, Python will call the C++ simulation runner by passing initial
positions for all of the wasps, getting new positions back. This will allow for
interactive simulations with the C++ code.
